# Sustaining Remote-First Teams

#### @rachelcdavies @tes_engineering

Notes:  
Curious about how to build and sustain a ‘remote-first’ culture? At Tes we have more engineers working from home or travelling than sitting at a desk in our London office. Over the last few years we adapted our engineering practices to support small teams working in close collaboration over distance. Part of what sustains this way of working is the way we organise hack days and engineering weeks and other cross-team initiatives.

## A Personal Story

Notes: 
Before I worked at Tes, I lived in Rugby - 100 miles north of London. My commute was 90mins from door-to-door, I spent a minimum of 7.5 hours travelling to work each week when there were no train delays. Most evenings I got home after 7:30pm. When my kids were younger this was just in time to read them a bedtime story but too late for family meals.

## Software is Special

![Egg Cup](images/egg-cup.jpg)

Notes: I was trying to describe what it's like to make software to my neighbour. Software as a material is not like a physical material. If you make an egg-cup it can be used by 1 person at a time in the same location. If you make software, it can be used by many people in different locations at the same time.
