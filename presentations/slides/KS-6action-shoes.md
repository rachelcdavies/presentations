# Fixing problems for good

Six Action Shoes written by Edward de Bono, 1992

Notes:  This is a short talk about a simple technique that can help, when you encounter unexpected problems, to resolve them more effectively. 
As software engineers, we are dealing with complex systems and it's important not only to address side-effects but also root causes.
The technique is from an old book called "Six Action Shoes" by Edward de Bono. 
Some of you may have heard of another book he wrote called 6 thinking hats and from that book "black hat thinking" but 
I will be focussing on the action shoes not thinking hats.
Six Action Shoes is a mnemonic or in plain English a system for helping you to remember steps that may need to be taken.         
The idea is to use a selection of different shoes to remind you about aspects of problem solving and with complex problems and to prevent similar problems happening again.
I will explain what each of the shoes is in this system and then summarise.

Orange = Emergency Action

Notes: what is a quick thing you can do to buy time to solve the problem? 
Often we rollback code or switch services off.

Brown = Practical Steps

Notes: let customer service team know, prepare an explanation for non-technical people.
Divert team to help you. Let other teams know if they will be impacted.

Notes: At TES we have systems in place to support the engineers when we are faced with a problem that may risk damage to our users and their personal data.
       We have a WAR ROOM and PEs write up post-mortem reports.
       We may also need to establish new procedures.

Purple = Get Authority

Notes: Do you need to pay for something? Better tools, more resources
       Is this someone's job? Should it be?

---

Pink = Care for People

Notes: check people are ok and don't feel blamed
Are people stressed out? High emotions can get in the way of learning
