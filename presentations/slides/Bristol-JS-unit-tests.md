# Hidden Benefits 
# of Unit Tests

Notes:  
Unit tests provide a quick way for us to confirm our code is working as we expect,
many developers remain unconvinced whether it's worth investing time writing unit tests, 
especially in front-end projects. 
Once we have implemented a working solution, there's often pressure to move on to adding more crowd-pleasing features rather than trying to wrap our code 
with tests. 
The benefit of writing unit tests is not limited to automated checking our code still works. 
I'll share some less obvious benefits for investing time writing unit tests with some 
examples drawn from a recent project using GraphQL.

## A bit about me

* Full-stack software engineer
* Work remotely based in Bath
* Longtime XP fan, co-author of Agile Coaching book


Notes: I started coding in 1987 before the web and JavaScript existed.
I spent time coding in Ada, C, C++, Java and Ruby. Relatively new to JavaScript.
In 2000, I was an early adopter of eXtreme Programming an Agile software development approach.
After some years consulting, I made a shift back to coding so I could stop commuting to London.
Moved to Bath before Xmas and work from home for Tes.
